### Hey there, nice to meet you!
## My name's Néctar! 
I'm a mechanical engineering undergraduate, with a minor in robotics! 🤖 <br>

I'm currently learning Python, Github, ROS2 and CAD. Also trying to better make and organize documentation.

My motivation right now is that I want to learn how to write the most efficient and clean code solutions possible and the most thorough and useful documentation for my projects, designs and experimentations. 

My end goal is to collect all the necessary skills I need to be able to build anything that pops into my mind. 


I already have a lot of ideas, I hope to be able to make them soon! 🌠

I'm always eager to learn something new ✨
