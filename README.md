### Hey there, nice to meet you! <br>
#### My name's Néctar!
- 🤖 I'm a mechanical engineering undergraduate, with a minor in robotics!
- 📖 I'm currently learning Python, Github, ROS2 and CAD. Also trying to better make and organize documentation.
- 🔥 My motivation right now is that I want to learn how to write the most efficient and clean code solutions possible and the most thorough and useful documentation for my projects, designs and experimentations. 

- 🚀 My end goal is to collect all the necessary skills I need to be able to build anything from my head! (Especially with high quality 😉)

I already have a lot of ideas, I hope to be able to make them soon! 🌠

I'm always eager to learn something new.
